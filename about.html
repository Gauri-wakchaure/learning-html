        <h2>About My HTML Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my website! I am currently learning HTML as the foundation of my journey into web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It allows me to design web pages by organizing
            text, images, links, tables, and more in a meaningful way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through hands-on practice and various projects, I am gaining skills in creating user-friendly and responsive web pages. My goal is to build a strong base in HTML before moving forward to advanced technologies like CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is a reflection of what Iâ€™ve learned so far and a platform to showcase my progress. Stay tuned as I continue to improve and expand my web development skills!
