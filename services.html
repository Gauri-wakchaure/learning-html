        <h2>My HTML Services</h2>
        <pre>
            As I continue my journey in web development, I am currently focused on mastering HTML â€“ the foundational language of the web. I am gaining practical experience in creating clean, well-structured web pages using semantic HTML elements.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            I offer basic HTML services such as creating static websites, designing simple web page layouts, formatting text and images, building HTML tables, and adding useful elements like forms, lists, and hyperlinks. Each project helps me refine my skills and
            better understand how to build accessible, user-friendly web pages.
        </pre>
        <pre>
            While I'm still in the learning phase, I am committed to delivering neat and functional HTML code that meets the standards of modern web design. These services are part of my growth as a future full-stack web developer.
